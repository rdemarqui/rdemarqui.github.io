## Classification 
### Financial Distress Prediction
Credit scoring algorithms, which make a guess at the probability of default, are the method banks use to determine whether or not a loan should be granted. In this Kaggle competition, participants was required to improve on the state of the art in credit scoring, by predicting the probability that somebody will experience financial distress in the next two years.

To tackle this problem, I implemented several models and compared them to find out which one got the best score. After fine tune the winner, I used SHAP to explain which features were most important to the model.
