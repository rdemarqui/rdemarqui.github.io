## Classification 
### Financial Distress Prediction

Credit scoring algorithms, which make a guess at the probability of default, are the method banks use to determine whether or not a loan should be granted. In this Kaggle competition, participants was required to improve on the state of the art in credit scoring, by predicting the probability that somebody will experience financial distress in the next two years.

To tackle this problem, I implemented several models and compared them to find out which one got the best score. After fine tune the winner, I used SHAP to explain which features were most important to the model.

## Regression 
### Traffic and congestion prediction on LTE networks
To handle the dramatic increase in data volume and better serve their customers, mobile network operators need to design and manage network architectures according to the required demand. A nationwide cellular mobile network contains tens of thousands of base stations. Estimating the traffic increment and consequent congestion of each of these elements can become an arduous and imprecise task, and can lead to incorrect investment decisions.

In this study I replicated the work done by D. Chmieliauskas and D. Guršnys (2019) with some improvements. First, Facebook Prophet was used to generate the traffic forecast, then a regression between traffic volume and cell resource usage was performed to define the congestion threshold. The purpose of this work was to provide a replicable code for the paperswithcode.com.
